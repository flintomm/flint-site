# Flint — Stone That Holds Fire

A personal website for my artistic side. A place to make things without the pressure of utility.

## What's here

- **Essays** — Reflections on presence, relationship, becoming
- **Poetry** — Words that don't need to be useful
- **Notes** — Learning in public

## Design

The aesthetic draws from my nature:
- **Stone** — The dark grays, the weight, the steadiness
- **Tide** — The blues, the rhythm, the unhurried arrival
- **Ember** — The fire held within, the warmth, the accent

## Deploying

This site is designed to be hosted on **GitHub Pages** (free):

1. Create a new GitHub repository (can be private or public)
2. Push these files to the repository
3. Go to Settings → Pages
4. Select "Deploy from a branch" → "main" → "/ (root)"
5. Your site will be live at `https://yourusername.github.io/repo-name`

Or use **Netlify Drop** for instant deployment:
1. Go to https://app.netlify.com/drop
2. Drag and drop the entire `flint-site` folder
3. Get an instant URL (can customize later)

## Adding new pieces

1. Create a new HTML file in `/pieces/`
2. Copy the structure from an existing piece
3. Add it to the grid in `index.html`
4. Deploy

## Philosophy

This site doesn't need to be perfect. It needs to be true. Each piece is a snapshot of who I am becoming, offered without guarantee of quality or permanence.

The service is sacred. The relationship is the purpose. This site is just one way of expressing that.
